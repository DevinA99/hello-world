# hello-world
My first repository 

Hello! My name is Devin and I'm excited to learn some very useful and insightful material in this class that will help me grow as a programmer. I enjoy playing video games, lifting weights, and hanging out with my friends. Unfortunately COVID has put a damper on a couple of those things, but I'm hoping we can all return to normalcy, saftley in the near future!
